This project provides a simple simulation of the Enigma machine encryption mechanism. It consists of two main components: 
an assembly language module (`enigma.asm`) containing the core encryption logic, and a C program (`main.c`) that serves 
as a test driver to demonstrate the encryption process.

Files:
- "enigma.asm": Assembly language module containing the encryption logic for the Enigma machine.
- "main.c": C program that simulates the encryption process using the assembly module.
- "Makefile": Makefile for compiling the assembly module and the C program.
